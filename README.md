# JesseAndCookies
Java solution to Hackerrank's Jesse and cookies problem

Input to be supplied via console or terminal in the format:
**n k l**
where n = list size, k = desired sweetness, and l = list of values

i.e. `3 7 1 1 1` would represent list size of 3 (`{1, 1, 1}`) and desired sweetness level of 7
